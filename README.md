kit-builder.io is a site dedicated to helping Splatoon 3 fans create and post their ideal gear kits. Users can create an account, submit their own kit-lists, and view others' kit creations. This site was designed to be similar to [sendou.ink](https://sendou.ink/builds/sploosh-o-matic). These builds are created by competitive players to show off their builds and help other members of the community decide how they want to build their own gear.

Each gear loadout contains a weapon, headgear, shirt, and shoes. Each weapon slot contains four ability slots, where users can put their preferred abilities in each section.

For this site, I used PHP and JS to display the gear loadout. I used CSV files for storing information for the weapon, headgear, shoes, shirts, and abilities. Each has a value for the form, a plaintext display name, and a Users were also stored on a CSV file.

When filling out the gear loadout, the script matches each value to the correct display name and image URL inside the CSVs and displays them. A user can then submit their loadout, give it a name, and it will be displayed on the homepage.

This site was originally hosted on the college's web server, [here is a demonstration of the site.](https://youtu.be/mium3XKVhH0)
